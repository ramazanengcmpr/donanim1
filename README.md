roject Definition: Develop a simulation module for CNFR33D, a free, open-source 3D milling software, to visualize the milling process and predict the outcome.

Goals:

Develop a basic simulation module: Create a simulation module that can visualize the milling process and predict the outcome.
Integrate with the existing GUI: Integrate the simulation module with the existing GUI to provide a seamless user experience.
Objectives:

Week 1:

Research and planning:
Research existing simulation libraries and tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly, Three.js).
I will use the python programming language to develop the simulation.
Plan the simulation module's architecture and design.
Define the simulation's input and output parameters.
Simulation core development:
Develop the core simulation algorithm to visualize the milling process.
Implement basic simulation features (e.g., tool movement, material removal).
Week 2:

GUI integration:
Integrate the simulation module with the existing GUI.
Develop a user interface to input simulation parameters (e.g., tool diameter, feed rate).
Display the simulation results in a 3D visualization.
Testing and refinement:
Test the simulation module with various input parameters and 3D models.
Refine the simulation algorithm to improve accuracy and performance.
Deliverables:

A functional simulation module that visualizes the milling process and predicts the outcome.
A user interface to input simulation parameters and display the simulation results.
A report detailing the simulation module's architecture, design, and testing results.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Simulation accuracy: Measure the accuracy of the simulation results compared to real-world milling processes.
Simulation performance: Measure the simulation module's performance in terms of speed and responsiveness.
User experience: Evaluate the user experience and usability of the simulation module.
