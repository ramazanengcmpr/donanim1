Daday 3-4: Simulation Core Development

Develop the Core Simulation Algorithm

Implement the basic simulation algorithm using Python. Focus on visualizing the milling process and predicting the outcome. Use NumPy and SciPy libraries for numerical computations.

Implement Basic Simulation Features

Tool Movement: Implement the movement of the tool along the tool path.
Material Removal: Implement the removal of material as the tool moves along the tool path.
Basic Visualization: Implement a basic visualization of the milling process using Matplotlib or Plotly.

# Simulation Core Report

## Implementation Details

The simulation core algorithm was implemented using Python and NumPy. The algorithm consists of three main components:

1. **Tool Movement**: The tool movement is calculated by subtracting the current tool position from the next tool position.
2. **Material Removal**: The material removal is calculated using the material properties, tool properties, and tool movement.
3. **Workpiece Geometry Update**: The workpiece geometry is updated by subtracting the material removed from the current workpiece geometry.

The simulation core algorithm is implemented in the `SimulationCore` class, which takes in the tool path, material properties, and tool properties as inputs. The `simulate_milling_process` method simulates the milling process by iterating through the tool path and updating the workpiece geometry accordingly. The `visualize_simulation_results` method visualizes the simulation results using Matplotlib.

## Challenges Faced

One of the challenges faced during implementation was ensuring that the material removal calculation was accurate and consistent. This was achieved by carefully implementing the material removal formula and testing it with different input values.

Another challenge was visualizing the simulation results in 3D. This was achieved by using Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities and carefully configuring the plot to display the workpiece geometry correctly.

Overall, the simulation core algorithm was successfully implemented and tested, and it provides a solid foundation for further development of the CNFR33D simulation module.
